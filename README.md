# eyeSyphon
A super simple PS3 Eye -> Syphon app. It grabs video from the first USB-connected PS3 Eye it finds and publishes the video to a Syphon server.

##Requirements
To compile, you'll need OpenFrameworks, ofxSyphon, ofxPS3Grabber and ofxKinect. Since ofxSyphon is not supported for 64-bit OF yet, the project must be compiled for i386.

##Releases
There is a compiled version in the bin folder.
